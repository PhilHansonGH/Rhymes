Since it’s been a hot second since I made an attempt
To take a seat and just, cripple any beat as I vent
I’ve been discrete, in the shadow, haven’t had a release
But best believe the skill hasn’t decreased, cause Phil a beast
With, a Hieroglyph in the sand, future plans drawn
But like a Blizzard exec, remaining hands on
The battle horn, sounds, then I appear
It’s guaranteed I got the illest shit to drop in the year
And no disrespect to all of my peers, we push each other
To write a verse that everybody rightfully fears
You can find my people under the stairs, they cella dwellers
A perfect match, holding you down, when no-one cares
Look, I tend to write what I like, I think it’s obvious
Programmer with grammar, alliteration laureate 
Every single one of my variants is notorious 
And know for laborious, acts before an audience
Rapt, they pay attention, everything that I say
For that respect earned tomorrow, write them lyrics today
I’m saying, it’s like you people forgot, I live in Phoenix
But I’m still the reason cats, know the city is hot
I always give the track whatever I got, you hire me for a verse
I guarantee I’ll try to body your spot
Listen, I heard that slick talk, it’s ain’t for me
Because I’m everything in talent that you dying to be
And I don’t spend effort, everything I write is for free
You ain’t Invincible, I’m Battle Beast in punishing beats
And few of ya’ll, better than me, please, you Antivaxxers
The only thing denial getting you is deceased
